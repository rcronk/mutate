todo:
make creature test.

I'm going to attempt to model abiogenesis by starting with an empty file and
try to create a program from nothing (it doesn't work - I already tried it.).
I'll also keep the current model of modifying a preexisting program. I'll also
have it take a quote from Shakespeare and enhance that. Ill also model
adaptation by letting the mutations turn a knob that could represent beak
length to show that can work just fine. Each program being modified will have a
unit test that will act as an environment that will evaluate how well the
mutation worked. I'm going to create an imperfect copier that will randomly
prepend, insert, append, or overwrite certain portions of the code according to
probabilities passed into it. I'll also have it gather statistics about what
kinds of modifications were done and what percentages of modifications improved
it versus degraded it versus killing it. I might later on create programs that
"mate" and produce offspring and thereby self-replicate, but that work would
assume that the random abiogenesis program could create such a self-replicating
program from scratch.
