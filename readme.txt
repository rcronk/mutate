todo:
- python 2/3 support
- http://www.nltk.org (Natural Language Toolkit for python)
- enhance statistics about what kinds of modifications were done and what percentages of modifications improved it versus degraded it versus killing it.
- create programs that "mate" and produce offspring and thereby self-replicate, but that work would assume that the random abiogenesis program could create such a self-replicating program from scratch.
- mutate a json or xml document since it seems that DNA information is more like a document than executable code perhaps?
