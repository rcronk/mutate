- have it take a quote from Shakespeare and enhance that.
- pylint / pyflakes / etc.
- spell checking
- kincade reading level

- enhance statistics about what kinds of modifications were done and what percentages of modifications improved it versus degraded it versus killing it.
- create programs that "mate" and produce offspring and thereby self-replicate, but that work would assume that the random abiogenesis program could create such a self-replicating program from scratch.
