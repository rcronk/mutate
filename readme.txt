todo:
- have it take a quote from Shakespeare and enhance that.
- pylint / pyflakes / etc.
- python 2/3 support
- spell checking
- kincade reading level
- Fix strange bug that lets mutations in (delete .pyc file)
- model adaptation by letting the mutations turn a knob that could represent beak length to show that can work just fine.
- enhance statistics about what kinds of modifications were done and what percentages of modifications improved it versus degraded it versus killing it.
- create programs that "mate" and produce offspring and thereby self-replicate, but that work would assume that the random abiogenesis program could create such a self-replicating program from scratch.
